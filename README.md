Digital Clock Using Js

I created this practice project to enhance my understanding of the JavaScript Date object and to experiment with responsive design techniques using Tailwind CSS.

Live Demo: https://digitalclock-0k6u.onrender.com/

Project Overview
In this project, I've built a straightforward web application that leverages the JavaScript Date object to display dynamic date and time information. Additionally, I've incorporated responsive design practices with Tailwind CSS to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Features
Dynamic Date and Time Display: My project prominently showcases the current date and time, offering users a real-time experience.

Responsive Design: I've used Tailwind CSS to make sure my project is fully responsive, adapting gracefully to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

User-Friendly Interface: The design is user-friendly and visually appealing, making it easy for users to access and comprehend the displayed information.
